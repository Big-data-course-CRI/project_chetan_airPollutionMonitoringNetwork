# Air Pollution Monitoring Network
This project aims at applying network analysis to study the effects of changing weather on the daily fluctuations of air pollution

## Introduction
Air pollution occurs when excessive amounts of gases, particulates and  volatile organic compounds are introduced into the atmosphere. It plays an important role in a wide range of environmental and health problems and has been one of the major problems to deal with for any nation.

Air pollution kills an estimated 8 million people worldwide every year[1]

Meteorological conditions largely contribute to the high concentrations of PM2.5 with more frequent occurrences of stagnant weather, less rainfall, and low temperature are not good for pollution dispersion. The aim of this project is to create a novel multilayer and multivariable network to detect the influence of weather dynamics on the temporal variability of surface air pollution
To apply network analysis to study datasets containing PM2.5 emissions from different sectors
